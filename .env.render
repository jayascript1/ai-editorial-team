# Environment Variables for Render Deployment
# These variables will be set in the Render dashboard

# Required: OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Flask Configuration
FLASK_ENV=production

# Render automatically provides PORT environment variable
# PORT=10000 (automatically set by Render)

# Instructions for setting up environment variables in Render:
# 1. Go to your Render dashboard
# 2. Select your web service
# 3. Go to Environment tab
# 4. Add the following environment variables:
#    - OPENAI_API_KEY: Your actual OpenAI API key (keep this secure!)
#    - OPENAI_MODEL: gpt-4o-mini (or your preferred model)
#    - FLASK_ENV: production

# Security Notes:
# - Never commit your actual API key to version control
# - Use Render's environment variable feature for secure injection
# - Monitor API usage and set up billing alerts
# - Rotate API keys regularly for security
