# AI Editorial Team

A sleek, modern web application that uses CrewAI to generate high-quality content through a team of specialized AI agents.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Uses CrewAI with specialized agents for research, writing, editing, and social media
- **Sleek Modern UI**: Beautiful dark theme with glassmorphism effects and smooth animations
- **Real-time Processing**: Live updates as your AI team works through the content creation process
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all devices

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (Port 5173)
- **Backend**: Flask API with CrewAI integration (Port 5001)
- **AI**: CrewAI agents for research, writing, editing, and social media

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- OpenAI API key

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The backend will start at `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter any topic in the sleek interface
2. **AI Processing**: Your CrewAI team processes the topic through 4 stages:
