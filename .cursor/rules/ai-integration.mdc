# AI Integration Guidelines

## CrewAI Agent Design
- Define agents with specific, focused roles
- Use clear, actionable goals for each agent
- Create compelling backstories that guide behavior
- Set appropriate verbose levels for debugging

## Task Definition
- Define tasks with clear, measurable expected outputs
- Use descriptive task descriptions
- Ensure proper task sequencing and dependencies
- Implement proper error handling for AI failures

## OpenAI Integration
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement proper rate limiting and error handling
- Use appropriate model selection for different tasks
- Monitor API usage and costs

## Real-time Communication
- Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming
- Use proper event handling and cleanup
- Handle connection errors gracefully
- Implement reconnection logic when needed

## Content Generation
- Validate user inputs before AI processing
- Implement content filtering and safety measures
- Use appropriate content length limits
- Ensure generated content meets quality standards

## Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling for AI operations
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring
- Implement fallback strategies for AI failures

## Performance Optimization
- Use streaming responses for long-running operations
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor AI response times
- Optimize agent workflows for efficiency
