# Development Workflow Guidelines

## Project Setup
- Use the provided `start.sh` script for initial setup
- Ensure both frontend and backend are running simultaneously
- Frontend runs on Vite dev server (typically port 5173)
- Backend runs on Flask (typically port 5001)

## Development Process
- Follow DRY principles - minimize code duplication
- Use React for UI components and Vite for build tooling
- Implement Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Test both frontend and backend functionality together

## Code Organization
- Keep frontend and backend concerns separated
- Use proper import/export patterns
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions
- Group related functionality in appropriate directories

## Testing & Debugging
- Use browser dev tools for frontend debugging
- Implement proper console logging for development
- Test API endpoints independently
- Verify real-time streaming functionality

## Deployment Considerations
- Build frontend for production (`npm run build`)
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured
- Test CrewAI integration with production API keys
- Monitor API usage and costs in production

## Common Commands
- **Start Development**: `./start.sh`
- **Frontend Only**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- **Backend Only**: `cd backend && python app.py`
- **Build Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- **Install Dependencies**: `npm install` (frontend) / `pip install -r requirements.txt` (backend)
